## OS Support

This Feature works on recent versions of Redhat UBI distributions. `bash` is required to execute the `install.sh` script. An `ansible-core` bootstrap instance owned by the `ansible` bootstrap user performs the heavy lifting.

## Example Usage

*accept option values*

```json
// devcontainer.json
...
"features": {
    "./tls-crypto-legacy-unsafe-policies-feature": {}
},
...
```
